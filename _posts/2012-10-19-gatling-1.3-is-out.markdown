title: Gatling 1.3 is Out
---

If you don't know the project, you can look at [this article]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2012-04-01-gatling-stress-tool-made-efficient.markdown %}).

## From then to now

It's been almost one year since the first public release of Gatling was announced. What a journey! Here are some numbers about the project:

* 1 major release
* 3 minor releases
* 14 fix packs
* 20k LoC
* [21 contributors](https://github.com/excilys/gatling/graphs/contributors)
* More than 2500 downloads
* 650 downloads of Gatling 1.2.5 (available two months for download during summer)
* 2 conferences ([Devoxx France 2012](http://www.devoxx.com/display/FR12/Realiser+des+tests+de+charges+avec+Gatling) and [Mix-IT 2012](http://www.mix-it.fr/session/25/stresser-son-application-avec-gatling))
* 5 presentations at user groups

Even though I can not contribute to Gatling as much as I have done in the first months, I'm really happy to see the interest in Gatling growing like that :).

## Gatling 1.3

In the last months, [Stéphane Landelle](https://github.com/slandelle), [Nicolas Rémond](https://github.com/nire), [Grégory Coutant](https://github.com/gcoutant), [Pierre Dal-Pra](https://github.com/pdalpra) and [Bastien Lemale](https://github.com/excilys-blemale) have been working hard to release Gatling 1.3.

Since 1.1, here are the major changes that happened:

* General
	* __Incremental compilation of scenarios__ &mdash; When executing Gatling you won't have to wait for all the scenarios to compile each time
	* __Console Dashboard__ &mdash; More information are displayed in the console when simulations are running
	* __Real-time feedback with Graphite Integration__ &mdash; Gatling can send data to a graphite server during the simulation.
* DSL
	* __Refactored structures__ &mdash; Keeping the DSL simple and explicit is really important, scenarios are even more easy to read/write now
	* __Many new keywords__ &mdash; There are less and less things that cannot be expressed with the DSL
	* __DSL for durations__ &mdash; Coming from Akka, durations can be expressed as easily as `3 ms`
* HTTP
	* __Better performance__ &mdash; Netty has been upgraded, it comes with better performance
	* __Simple cache support__ &mdash; Gatling will now interpret some cache headers
	* __Multi file upload__ &mdash; Send many files in your requests
* Reports
	* __Redesign of charts for better reading__ &mdash; Gatling's reports were nice, but now they're even nicer
	* __More information for global report__ &mdash; All the details computed for each request are now also computed at a global level
	* __CSV export of reports__ &mdash; For those who need to work with the data

These are some of the [many new features](https://github.com/excilys/gatling/wiki/Changelog) of Gatling. As you can see, there have been many improvements since the first version of the project last year.

Gatling's lead (Stéphane Landelle) really drives the project toward good quality. To achieve excellent quality, user feedback is _very_ important for us. If you use Gatling and find yourself frustrated about something, you can check the [documentation](https://github.com/excilys/gatling/wiki) of the project, or its new [cheat sheet](http://galting-tool.org/cheat-sheet). If you can't find an answer to your problem, please start or contribute to a topic on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gatling) :)

## What's next?

For the future, there are at least three other cool features planned: 

1. __A Jenkins Plugin__ &mdash; It already works, but as the code is not 'good enough' yet, it should be released in the next weeks
2. __Request Grouping__ &mdash; It will allow one to create groups of requests to obtain statistics about them in the reports
3. __Clustering mode__ &mdash; As soon as [Akka](http://akka.io) is realeased with clustering support, we'll start to work on this

In terms of spreading the love around the project, we will be [presenting Gatling](http://devoxx.com/display/DV12/Blast+your+webapp+with+Gatling) at [Devoxx 2012](http://devoxx.com) in Antwerp, Belgium! We're excited to present Gatling in English at this huge conference :)

Gatling has also been invited to several user groups in Europe: Luxembourg, Lausanne, Lille, Bordeaux, and others!

If you need a stress tool, give [Gatling](http://gatling-tool.org) a try, it's really worth it! And please, if you find it useful, spread the word :)
